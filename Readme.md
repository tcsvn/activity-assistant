Activities of Daily living (ADLs) such as eating, working, sleeping and Smart Home device readings are recorded by its inhabitants. The projects aim is to predict inhabitants activities from device recordings. Activity Assistant is a platform that streamlines the process of data collection. Multiple devices and subjects may be tracked using an additional android or the Home Assistants companion app. Furthermore, Activity Assistant (will) support the deployment of trained models and running predictions in real-time. A (future) Home Assistant integration offers user a novel activity-based abstraction to automate their homes upon.

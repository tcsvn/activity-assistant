Activities of Daily living (ADLs) e.g cooking, working, sleeping and device readings are recorded by smart home inhabitants. The goal is to predict inhabitants activities using device readings. Activity-assistant is a platform that streamlines the process of data collection. Selected devices and persons can be tracked. Using the android app, device readings are labeled with current activities. Furthermore activity-assistant supports the deployment of trained models running predictions in real-time. A homeassistant integration offers users a way to automate things based on activity predictions.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in comparison to installing any other Hass.io add-on.

1. add the repository to the addon-store by pasting `https://github.com/tcsvn/hassio-activity-assistant` into the manage add-on repositories dialog  
2. Ensure that Home Assistant is using the [recorder](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/recorder/) integration for activity-assistant to successfully query data
3. Search for the "activity-assistant" addon-on in the Hass.io add-on store and install it.
4. Start the "activity-assistant" add-on.
5. Check the logs of the add-on to see if everything went well.
6. Ready to go!

Activities of Daily living (ADLs) such as eating, working, sleeping and Smart Home device readings are recorded by inhabitants. Predicting resident activity from the device event stream enables a variety of
applications. Activity Assistant is a platform that streamlines the data collection process. Multiple devices or subjects are tracked using an additional [Android](https://github.com/tcsvn/activity-assistant-logger) or the Home Assistants companion app. Furthermore, Activity Assistant (will) support the deployment of trained models and running ADL predictions in real-time. A (future) Home Assistant integration offers users a novel activity based abstraction to automate their homes upon.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different to installing any other Hass.io add-on.

1. Add the repository to the addon-store by pasting `https://github.com/tcsvn/hassio-activity-assistant` into the manage add-on repositories dialog
2. Ensure that Home Assistant is using the [recorder](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/recorder/) integration for Activity Assistant to successfully connect to the database and query devices
3. Search for the "Activity Assistant" addon-on in the Hass.io add-on store and install the latest release (NOT edge or development).
4. Start the "Activity Assistant" add-on.
5. Check the logs of the add-on to see if everything went well.
6. Ready to go!
